# TinyTrack — Production-Grade Overhaul Changelog

Overnight upgrade run, 2026-06-09 → 2026-06-10. Goal: keep the existing skeleton (Riverpod + GoRouter + Supabase), upgrade everything to a premium, production-grade standard.

Process: small working increments, committed and pushed continuously. Self-review every 5 commits (analyze + diff re-read).

## Plan

1. Clean analyzer baseline (45 info issues → 0)
2. Design-system foundation: spacing/radius tokens, shared dialogs/snackbars/components
3. Supabase schema audit + DB improvements (indexes, RLS, missing tables)
4. Premium polish per screen group: auth/splash/onboarding → dashboard → tracking screens → data screens → profile/settings
5. Robustness: offline banner, retry states, validation bounds
6. Docs: README rewrite, this changelog, final full-diff review

## Changes

(appended as work lands; one entry per commit)

### 1. Clean analyzer baseline (45 → 0 issues)
- `dart fix --apply` resolved 38 auto-fixable lints (wildcard underscores, unnecessary `this.`, string interpolation, dangling doc comment).
- Manual fixes: splash screen now re-checks `mounted` after the SharedPreferences await before navigating; 4 deprecated `withOpacity` calls → `withValues(alpha:)`; photo viewer delete uses `context.mounted` guard.
- Also: autonomous-session setup — `.claude/settings.local.json` gitignored, `docs/CHANGELOG-claude.md` created.
